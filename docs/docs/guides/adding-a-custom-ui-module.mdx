# Adding a Custom UI module

Custom UI is a way of providing a user interface in a Forge application. It allows developers to have almost complete freedom of technology choice as long as it produces Javascript. For this guide, we explain adding a React-based Custom UI implemented in Typescript. However, if you prefer to use other technologies, such as [Vue](https://nx.dev/nx-api/vue/documents/overview) or [Vite](https://nx.dev/nx-api/vite/documents/overview), it should work just as well, provided you can integrate with Atlassian's APIs.

## Installing @nx/react

If you have not installed [`@nx/react`](https://nx.dev/nx-api/react/documents/overview) in your workspace, you can install it by running the following command:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="afterNx18" label="Nx 18+" default>
    ```shell
    nx add @nx/react
    ``` 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="beforeNx18" label="Nx <18">
    ```shell
    npm i -D @nx/react
    ``` 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Generating a React application

With the React plugin installed, we can use the [React application generator](https://nx.dev/nx-api/react/generators/application) to scaffold a React application for our Custom UI. Replace `<custom-ui-app-name>` with the name of the Custom UI project you want to create.

```shell
nx g @nx/react:app <custom-ui-app-name>
```

:::tip

Use the `--dry-run` flag to see what will be generated.

To get the React application working as a Forge Custom UI we have to update the `apps/<custom-ui-app-name>/project.json` file. Open the file and replace the `baseHref` value in the build options with `.` instead of `/`. Refer to [the Forge documentation on accessing static assets for additional details](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/custom-ui/#accessing-static-assets).

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "root": "apps/<custom-ui-app-name>",
  "sourceRoot": "apps/<custom-ui-app-name>/src",
  "projectType": "application",
  "targets": {
    "build": {
      "executor": "@nx/webpack:webpack",
      "outputs": ["{options.outputPath}"],
      "defaultConfiguration": "production",
      "options": {
        "compiler": "babel",
        "outputPath": "dist/apps/<custom-ui-app-name>",
        "index": "apps/<custom-ui-app-name>/src/index.html",
        // highlight-next-line
        "baseHref": ".",
        ...
      }
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

## Wiring the Custom UI project with the Forge app project

The final step is to connect the Custom UI project to our Forge application. This step is crucial for Nx Forge to [register the dependency with the Nx project graph](../concepts/project-graph.md) and for the Nx Forge build task to assemble the Forge app correctly.

In the Forge app project, open the generated `manifest.yml` file and add a Custom UI module, the corresponding resource entry, and the `permissions` declaration. The example below adds the `jira:projectPage` module and the `project-page` resource declaration.

```yaml showLineNumbers title="manifest.yml"
modules:
# highlight-start
  jira:projectPage:
    - key: project-page
      title: Project page Custom UI
      layout: basic
      resource: project-page
      resolver:
        function: resolver
# highlight-end  
  function:
    - key: resolver
      handler: index.handler
# highlight-start
resources:
  - key: project-page
    path: <custom-ui-app-name>
    tunnel:
      port: 4200
permissions:
  content:
    styles:
      - 'unsafe-inline'
# highlight-end
app:
  id: ari:cloud:ecosystem::app/to-be-generated
```

The wiring of the Custom UI to the Forge application happens in the `path` property of the `project-page` resource. The `path` property must reference the Custom UI project name from the previous step. The plugin will replace this path with the path to the actual Custom UI build artifact during the Forge app build. Refer to [the project graph concept documentation](../concepts/project-graph.md) for further details.

With the default Nx workspace configuration, [the task pipeline](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks#defining-a-task-pipeline) is preconfigured such that before running the `build` target, it needs to run the `build` target on all the projects the current project depends on. This means if we run:

```shell
nx build <nx-forge-app-name>
```

Nx will invoke the `build` target of the Custom UI app first and then invoke the `build` target for the Forge app itself. We can now build our complete Forge application with a single command.
