# Migrating to a newer plugin version

As of plugin version 2.2.0, the plugin ships with migration scripts that allow you to use the [`nx migrate`](https://nx.dev/packages/nx/documents/migrate) to update your workspace to a newer version of `nx-forge`.

To update to the latest nx-forge version, run the command below and follow the instructions in the terminal output.

```shell
nx migrate @toolsplus/nx-forge@latest
```

Refer to the [Nx migrate docs](https://nx.dev/packages/nx/documents/migrate) for more details on how to use `nx migrate`.
