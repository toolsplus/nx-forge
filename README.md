[Nx plugin](https://nx.dev) for [Atlassian Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/) that aims to assist in efficient, scalable app development and remove the mental overhead of how to set up a Forge project. 
Building on top of Nx means shared code can easily be extracted into libraries, and [Custom UI](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/custom-ui/) can be integrated into the app and dev workflow without having to break with the monorepo structure that Nx provides.
